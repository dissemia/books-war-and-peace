<p>Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew
supposed.</p>
<p>After the return of Alp&#225;tych from Smol&#233;nsk the old prince suddenly
seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called
up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in
chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the
last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief&#8217;s
discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where
one of Russia&#8217;s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he
announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills.</p>
<p>But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of
the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Boguch&#225;rovo and
thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her father&#8217;s feverish and
sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to
leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey
him. She refused to go away and her father&#8217;s fury broke over her in a
terrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on
her. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused
his quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making
it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from
his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same
to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and
warned her not to dare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as
she had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her
not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof
that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and
had not gone away.</p>
<p>The morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned his
full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His cal&#232;che
was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in
his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his
armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window listening to
his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly several men came
running up the avenue with frightened faces.</p>
<p>Princess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path, and
into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving
toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by
the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and
decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that
fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,
could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see
was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one
of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his helpless
lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out what he
wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on the very
couch he had so feared of late.</p>
<p>The doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the
prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.</p>
<p>It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and
next day they moved the prince to Boguch&#225;rovo, the doctor accompanying
him.</p>
<p>By the time they reached Boguch&#225;rovo, Dessalles and the little prince
had already left for Moscow.</p>
<p>For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new
house Prince Andrew had built at Boguch&#225;rovo, ever in the same state,
getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like
a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips
twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was
going on around him or not. One thing was certain&#8212;that he was suffering
and wished to say something. But what it was, no one could tell: it
might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate
to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.</p>
<p>The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due
to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell
her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his
restlessness confirmed her opinion.</p>
<p>He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no
hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do
to let him die on the road. &#8220;Would it not be better if the end did come,
the very end?&#8221; Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly
sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched
him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find
symptoms of the approach of the end.</p>
<p>Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet
there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since
her father&#8217;s illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with
him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires and hopes
that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts
that had not entered her mind for years&#8212;thoughts of a life free from
the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and of family
happiness&#8212;floated continually in her imagination like temptations of the
devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions continually recurred
to her as to how she would order her life now, after that. These were
temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the
sole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She assumed
an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons, repeated the words of a
prayer, but she could not pray. She felt that a different world had
now taken possession of her&#8212;the life of a world of strenuous and free
activity, quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she
had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer.
She could not pray, could not weep, and worldly cares took possession of
her.</p>
<p>It was becoming dangerous to remain in Boguch&#225;rovo. News of the approach
of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten miles from
Boguch&#225;rovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.</p>
<p>The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the
provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary
to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the
rural police having come to Boguch&#225;rovo urged the same thing, saying
that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that French
proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the princess
did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could not answer
for the consequences.</p>
<p>The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of preparation
and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day.
She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in
the room next to the one where the prince lay. Several times, waking up,
she heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps
of T&#237;khon and the doctor when they turned him over. Several times she
listened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were
louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not
sleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter
but not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw
and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him.
She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she
sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in during
the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.</p>
<p>But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing
him. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his
found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid these memories
temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: thoughts of
how things would be after his death, and how her new, liberated life
would be ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward
morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.</p>
<p>She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her
clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father&#8217;s illness. On waking
she listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him
groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!&#8221; she
cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.</p>
<p>She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In
front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed
into the vehicles.</p>
<p>It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch, still
horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts
before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and went out to
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a little better today,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I was looking for you. One can
make out something of what he is saying. His head is clearer. Come in,
he is asking for you....&#8221;</p>
<p>Princess Mary&#8217;s heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale
and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk to
him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with
those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the doctor.</p>
<p>Princess Mary entered her father&#8217;s room and went up to his bed. He was
lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with
their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed
straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips
motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His face
seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown smaller.
Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand pressed hers
so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come. He
twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.</p>
<p>She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When
she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he
calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips
and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and
imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.</p>
<p>Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic
efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with
difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said something,
repeating the same words several times. She could not understand them,
but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words
he uttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm...ar...ate...ate...&#8221; he repeated several times.</p>
<p>It was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor thought
he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: &#8220;Mary, are you afraid?&#8221;
The prince shook his head, again repeated the same sounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mind, my mind aches?&#8221; questioned Princess Mary.</p>
<p>He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and
began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find
the right place for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always thoughts... about you... thoughts...&#8221; he then uttered much
more clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being
understood.</p>
<p>Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs
and tears.</p>
<p>He moved his hand over her hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been calling you all night...&#8221; he brought out.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only I had known...&#8221; she said through her tears. &#8220;I was afraid to
come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pressed her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you asleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I did not sleep,&#8221; said Princess Mary, shaking her head.</p>
<p>Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as
he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move
with difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear one... Dearest...&#8221; Princess Mary could not quite make out what he
had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender
caressing word such as he had never used to her before. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you
come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I was wishing for his death!&#8221; thought Princess Mary.</p>
<p>He was silent awhile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... thank
you!... forgive!... thank you!...&#8221; and tears began to flow from his
eyes. &#8220;Call Andrew!&#8221; he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression
of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.</p>
<p>He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it
seemed to Princess Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a letter from him,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>He glanced at her with timid surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s with the army, Father, at Smol&#233;nsk.&#8221;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in
answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and
remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, softly and distinctly. &#8220;Russia has perished. They&#8217;ve
destroyed her.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. Princess Mary
could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face.</p>
<p>Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and
T&#237;khon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.</p>
<p>Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could
understand for a long time, till at last T&#237;khon understood and repeated
it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in
which he had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of Russia,
or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and
so she could not guess his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put on your white dress. I like it,&#8221; was what he said.</p>
<p>Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor
taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to
persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the
prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the
Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and
then he had a second and final stroke.</p>
<p>Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot and
sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing,
except passionate love for her father, love such as she thought she had
never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as
far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had
planted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end
quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me? What
use will peace be when he is no longer here?&#8221; Princess Mary murmured,
pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom
which heaved with convulsive sobs.</p>
<p>When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her
again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne&#8212;who had remained
at Boguch&#225;rovo and did not wish to leave it&#8212;coming toward her with a
stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who
had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her
prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding him; she
led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then,
excusing herself, she went to the door of the old prince&#8217;s room. The
doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!&#8221;</p>
<p>She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the
slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how
long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman&#8217;s
footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Duny&#225;sha her maid,
who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in
alarm on seeing her mistress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please come, Princess... The Prince,&#8221; said Duny&#225;sha in a breaking
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immediately, I&#8217;m coming, I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; replied the princess hurriedly,
not giving Duny&#225;sha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to
avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Princess, it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will! You must be prepared for everything,&#8221; said
the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me alone; it&#8217;s not true!&#8221; she cried angrily to him.</p>
<p>The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her
father&#8217;s door. &#8220;Why are these people with frightened faces stopping me?
I don&#8217;t want any of them! And what are they doing here?&#8221; she thought.
She opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened
room startled her. In the room were her nurse and other women. They all
drew back from the bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the
bed as before, but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess
Mary stop short on the threshold.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s not dead&#8212;it&#8217;s impossible!&#8221; she told herself and approached
him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips
to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force of the
tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was
replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her. &#8220;No, he
is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and
hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!&#8221; And hiding
her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor,
who held her up.</p>
<p>In the presence of T&#237;khon and the doctor the women washed what had been
the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should
not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the
legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform
with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table.
Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done
as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his
coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of
juniper, a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head, and in a
corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms.</p>
<p>Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the
inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round
the coffin&#8212;the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women&#8212;and all with
fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old
prince&#8217;s cold and stiffened hand.</p>
