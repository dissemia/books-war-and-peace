<h2 id="ch:book-eleven-1812-chapter-xxix-dm-1"><span class="label">Chapter 29 </span></h2>
<p>When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again
thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to
go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite,
amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his
life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in
the parlor&#8212;the first room they entered. To Pierre&#8217;s assurances that he
was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone
could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and
said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it
be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude
for saving his life.</p>
<p>Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the
feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre&#8217;s feelings
were, the latter would probably have left him, but the man&#8217;s animated
obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,&#8221; said the officer, looking
at Pierre&#8217;s fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger.
&#8220;I owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never
forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That
is all I can say.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the
word) in the officer&#8217;s voice, in the expression of his face and in
his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the
Frenchman&#8217;s smile, pressed the hand held out to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion
of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,&#8221; he introduced
himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under
his mustache. &#8220;Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have
the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance
with that maniac&#8217;s bullet in my body?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,
began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for
concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please!&#8221; said he. &#8220;I understand your reasons. You are an officer...
a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. That&#8217;s not
my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at
your service. You belong to the gentry?&#8221; he concluded with a shade of
inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. &#8220;Your baptismal name, if you
please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... That&#8217;s all I
want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka
brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar
and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and
himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man,
munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking
his lips, and repeating&#8212;&#8220;Excellent! Delicious!&#8221; His face grew red and
was covered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner
with pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan
and placed a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass,
taken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known
to the French and had been given a special name. They called it limonade
de cochon (pig&#8217;s lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de
cochon he had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they
had taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and
applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up
to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain
still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for
saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my
body already. Here is one I got at Wagram&#8221; (he touched his side) &#8220;and a
second at Smol&#233;nsk&#8221;&#8212;he showed a scar on his cheek&#8212;&#8220;and this leg which as
you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great
battle of la Moskowa. Sacr&#233; Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of fire
was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! You may
be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught there, I
should be ready to begin again. I pity those who did not see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was there,&#8221; said Pierre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The
great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!&#8221; continued the Frenchman. &#8220;And
you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three times&#8212;sure as I sit here.
Three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back
like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your
grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six
times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of
Naples, who knows what&#8217;s what, cried &#8216;Bravo!&#8217; Ha, ha! So you are one of
us soldiers!&#8221; he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. &#8220;So much
the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle...
gallant... with the fair&#8221; (he winked and smiled), &#8220;that&#8217;s what the
French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain was so na&#239;vely and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so
pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily
at him. Probably the word &#8220;gallant&#8221; turned the captain&#8217;s thoughts to the
state of Moscow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left
Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?&#8221;
asked Pierre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, ha!&#8221; The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting
Pierre on the shoulder. &#8220;What a thing to say!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Paris?...
But Paris, Paris...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paris&#8212;the capital of the world,&#8221; Pierre finished his remark for him.</p>
<p>The captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the
middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you hadn&#8217;t told me you were Russian, I should have wagered
that you were Parisian! You have that... I don&#8217;t know what, that...&#8221; and
having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been in Paris. I spent years there,&#8221; said Pierre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn&#8217;t know Paris
is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la
Duch&#233;nois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,&#8221; and noticing that
his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly:
&#8220;There is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have
remained Russian. Well, I don&#8217;t esteem you the less for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had
spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed
talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.</p>
<p>&#8220;To return to your ladies&#8212;I hear they are lovely. What a wretched idea
to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in
Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants, now&#8212;that&#8217;s
another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know us better
than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all
the world&#8217;s capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to
know. And then the Emperor...&#8221; he began, but Pierre interrupted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Emperor,&#8221; Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and
embarrassed, &#8220;is the Emperor...?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius&#8212;that&#8217;s
what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you
I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But
that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist
the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France.
When I understood what he wanted&#8212;when I saw that he was preparing a bed
of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: &#8216;That is a monarch,&#8217; and
I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest
man of the ages past or future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he in Moscow?&#8221; Pierre stammered with a guilty look.</p>
<p>The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he will make his entry tomorrow,&#8221; he replied, and continued his
talk.</p>
<p>Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at
the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some W&#252;rttemberg hussars had
come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain&#8217;s
horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did
not understand what was said to them in French.</p>
<p>The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice
asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer,
and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already
occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the two first
questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding
officer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand
said, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the
quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to
occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German,
translated what the German said to the captain and gave the captain&#8217;s
reply to the W&#252;rttemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what
was said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The
captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.</p>
<p>When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as
before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He
really was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and he
was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position
he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy
conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as
that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the moment. He was
tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of
wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had
destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last
few days and which was essential for the execution of his design. The
pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the
town next day. Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and
worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not
do it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not
carry out his intention. He struggled against the confession of his
weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his
former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and
self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first
man he met.</p>
<p>The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.</p>
<p>The Frenchman&#8217;s chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled
him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which
he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. &#8220;I will go away
immediately. I won&#8217;t say another word to him,&#8221; thought Pierre. He
thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of
weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but
could not do so.</p>
<p>The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and
down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he
were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;The colonel of those W&#252;rttembergers is delightful,&#8221; he suddenly said.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he&#8217;s a German.&#8221;
He sat down facing Pierre. &#8220;By the way, you know German, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pierre looked at him in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the German for &#8216;shelter&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shelter?&#8221; Pierre repeated. &#8220;The German for shelter is Unterkunft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you say it?&#8221; the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unterkunft,&#8221; Pierre repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Onterkoff,&#8221; said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with
laughing eyes. &#8220;These Germans are first-rate fools, don&#8217;t you think so,
Monsieur Pierre?&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we?
Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!&#8221; he called out
gaily.</p>
<p>Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre
by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression
on his companion&#8217;s face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in
his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now, we&#8217;re sad,&#8221; said he, touching Pierre&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Have I
upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?&#8221; he asked Pierre.
&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s the state of affairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman&#8217;s eyes
whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for
you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death.
I say it with my hand on my heart!&#8221; said he, striking his chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Pierre.</p>
<p>The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that
&#8220;shelter&#8221; was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!&#8221; he cried gaily, filling
two glasses with wine.</p>
<p>Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too,
again pressed Pierre&#8217;s hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a
pensive attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear friend,&#8221; he began, &#8220;such is fortune&#8217;s caprice. Who would
have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the
service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow
with him. I must tell you, mon cher,&#8221; he continued in the sad and
measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, &#8220;that our name
is one of the most ancient in France.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with a Frenchman&#8217;s easy and na&#239;ve frankness the captain told Pierre
the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all
about his relations and his financial and family affairs, &#8220;ma pauvre
m&#232;re&#8221; playing of course an important part in the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;But all that is only life&#8217;s setting, the real thing is love&#8212;love! Am I
not right, Monsieur Pierre?&#8221; said he, growing animated. &#8220;Another glass?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, women, women!&#8221; and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at
Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.</p>
<p>There were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking
at the officer&#8217;s handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager
enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe&#8217;s love
stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special
charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such sincere
conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love
and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with
curiosity.</p>
<p>It was plain that l&#8217;amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not
that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor
was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for
Nat&#225;sha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one
he considered the &#8220;love of clodhoppers&#8221; and the other the &#8220;love
of simpletons.&#8221;) L&#8217;amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted
principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a
combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.</p>
<p>Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a
fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming,
innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The
conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in
the mother&#8217;s sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage
to her lover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of
a distant past. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband played
the part of the lover, and he&#8212;the lover&#8212;assumed the role of the husband,
as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of Germany,
where &#8220;shelter&#8221; is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat
sauerkraut and the young girls are &#8220;too blonde.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain&#8217;s
memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was
of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of
life continually occurred in the captain&#8217;s stories) and the Pole had
entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de c&#339;ur) while himself
entering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting
Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the
captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: &#8220;I have
saved your life, and I save your honor!&#8221; Having repeated these words the
captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the
weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.</p>
<p>Listening to the captain&#8217;s tales, Pierre&#8212;as often happens late in the
evening and under the influence of wine&#8212;followed all that was told him,
understood it all, and at the same time followed a train of personal
memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind. While
listening to these love stories his own love for Nat&#225;sha unexpectedly
rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that love in his
imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe&#8217;s tales. Listening
to the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before
his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of
his love at the S&#250;kharev water tower. At the time of that meeting it had
not produced an effect upon him&#8212;he had not even once recalled it. But
now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very
important and poetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Kir&#237;lovich, come here! We have recognized you,&#8221; he now seemed
to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her
smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there
seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.</p>
<p>Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain
asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice
himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.</p>
<p>Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to
express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he
understood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all
his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could
never be his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tiens!&#8221; said the captain.</p>
<p>Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest
years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too
young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.
Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of
her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in
the world, and especially therefore above himself.</p>
<p>When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he
understood that.</p>
<p>The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand
it he begged Pierre to continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plat&#243;nic love, clouds...&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the
thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who
played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together,
something loosened Pierre&#8217;s tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway
look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his
marriage, Nat&#225;sha&#8217;s love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and
all his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe&#8217;s questions
he also told what he had at first concealed&#8212;his own position and even
his name.</p>
<p>More than anything else in Pierre&#8217;s story the captain was impressed by
the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that
he had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there
concealing his name and station.</p>
<p>When it was late at night they went out together into the street. The
night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokr&#243;vka a
fire glowed&#8212;the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the
right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierre&#8217;s
heart with his love. At the gate stood Ger&#225;sim, the cook, and two
Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in
two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the
town.</p>
<p>There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense
city.</p>
<p>Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the
glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. &#8220;There now,
how good it is, what more does one need?&#8221; thought he. And suddenly
remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned
against the fence to save himself from falling.</p>
<p>Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with
unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and
immediately fell asleep.</p>
